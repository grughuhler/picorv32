This directory contains a simple C program that runs on the
picorv32 core on the simple SoC.

The build environment is limited. Some things to know:

* BSS (data not explicitly initialized) is NOT set to zero.
* No standard library functions are available.
* It's possible I missed some section type in the linker
  command file.
* The SoC has only 8192 bytes of SRAM so program cannot be
  large.
* There is no provision for interrupt handlers.

You will need the gcc cross compiler for riscv.  On Ubuntu 22.04,

  sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf

Basically, edit main.c and "make".  This will create mem_init.v in the
Verilog source directory-- so you need to rebuild and reload the FPGA
bitfile.

Program conv_to_init inputs a binary version of the image and creates
mem_init.v.

Hints:

  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d prog.elf will disassemble the code.

  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -x prog.elf shows sections and addresses.

  riscv64-unknown-elf-nm --numeric-sort shows symbols and addresses.
