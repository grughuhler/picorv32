This directory contains a simple SoC that uses the risc-v (32-bit)
core from https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32.  File picorv32.v is
from there.  It is the core.

Git branches contain later versions of this project.  The first after
the main branch is "infer_sram" which instantiates block SRAMs a
better way.

Then, "gowin_user_flash" adds a controller for internal flash on the
FPGA of the Tang Nano 9K.  You may want to use the latest branch rather
than the main branch.  You can do this by:

  git clone https://github.com/grughuhler/picorv32.git
  cd picorv32
  git branch -a  (to see all available branches)
  git checkout -b gowin_user_flash remotes/origin/gowin_user_flash

File top.v is the top level module and integrates the SoC's
components which are:

* The risc-v core.
* 8192 bytes of SRAM memory.
* A small reset controller.
* A UART (wrapper around the simpleuart from
  https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32).
* An LED driver that supports read and write.
* A 32-bit count-down timer that can be read and written.
  It counts down to zero and stops.

The project targets the Tang Nano 9K FPGA development board that
contains a Gowin GW1NR-9LV FPGA.  It is intended to be very
simple and direct.  There are no integration abstractions.

It was built using the educational version of the Gowin IDE and
tool chain, 1.9.9 Beta-4 Education Build(68283).

The Gowin IDE should build it.  See the README in directory c_code for
information on how to build the software.  The program already in
mem_init.v prints stuff and causes the LEDs on the board to count.  S1
is the reset button.  Serial port: 115200, no parity, no flow control.

The SRAM is initialized by the C code and then the Verilog build
process.  This is how the software is "loaded".  See README in
the c_code directory.
